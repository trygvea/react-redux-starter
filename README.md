# React redux starter kit

## This project have the intention of being a starter kit for the following stack:
* react
* redux
* redux-thunk - gives you a very clean way to write complex event handling
* immutable.js - handling state in redux *can* be done using plain js, but we should take care not to mutate the state. Immutable.js helps.
* webpack for transpiling, packing etc. With babel and some polyfills and more.
* webpack-dev-server for hot reloading
* es6!!! Javascript with es6++ feels like a new language compared to previous version for a n00b like me. Modules, arrow functions, destructors and lots of real useful syntactic sugar. 
* chrome plugins for react og redux. Gives you full time travel on your state, out of the box
